# Data-labelling-GUI-in-matplotlib

A GUI for relabelling misclassfied image data using matplotlib. This is part of an old project that I was part of on classifying different types of plants in ecology survey data, based purely upon camera data. 

The video of the GUI in use can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDPprYA3sA4
